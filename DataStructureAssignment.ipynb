        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Lists in Python are versatile and powerful data structures that allow you to store collections of items. Here are some key features of lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. **Ordered Collection**\n",
        "- Lists maintain the order of items, meaning that the elements can be accessed based on their index, which is zero-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. **Mutable**\n",
        "- Lists are mutable, allowing you to modify their contents after creation. You can add, remove, or change elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. **Dynamic Sizing**\n",
        "- Lists can grow or shrink in size. You can add elements without needing to define a fixed size beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. **Heterogeneous Elements**\n",
        "- Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. **Indexing and Slicing**\n",
        "- You can access elements using their index, and slicing allows you to retrieve a portion of the list. For example, `my_list[1:3]` gives you a sublist.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. **Built-in Methods**\n",
        "- Python lists come with a variety of built-in methods for common operations, such as:\n",
        "  - `append()`: Adds an element to the end.\n",
        "  - `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specified position.\n",
        "  - `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a value.\n",
        "  - `pop()`: Removes and returns an element at a given index.\n",
        "  - `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. **List Comprehensions**\n",
        "- You can create lists using concise syntax known as list comprehensions, which allow you to generate lists dynamically. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # Generates [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. **Nested Lists**\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Lists**: Mutable, meaning you can modify their contents (add, remove, or change elements).\n",

        "# **Question 8.** Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Answer:\n",
        "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable data types. This immutability is crucial for several reasons, primarily related to the functionality and integrity of dictionaries. Here’s a detailed discussion of the importance of immutable keys, along with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of Immutable Keys\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashability**:\n",
        "   - Dictionary keys are hashed to create a unique identifier for each key. This hash is used to quickly access values. If a key were mutable and changed, it would affect its hash value, leading to inconsistencies and making it impossible to locate the associated value.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = { (1, 2): \"Point A\" }  # Tuple (1, 2) is immutable and can be a key\n",
        "   # my_dict[(1, 2)]  # Valid lookup\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # my_dict[[1, 2]] = \"Point B\"  # This would raise a TypeError, since lists are mutable\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - Immutable keys ensure that once a key is set, it cannot be altered, which maintains the integrity of the dictionary. This prevents unexpected behavior caused by unintentional changes to keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {'name': 'Alice'}\n",
        "   # my_dict['name'][0] = 'B'  # This would not work because strings are immutable, ensuring the key stays consistent\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Consistent Behavior**:\n",
        "   - The requirement for immutable keys leads to predictable behavior in dictionaries. You can rely on the fact that once you insert a key-value pair, the key will always point to the same value unless explicitly changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\n",
        "   print(my_dict[1])  # Output: 'one'\n",
        "   # my_dict[1] = 'uno'  # Changing the value associated with the immutable key 1\n",
